This was the only salvation from drowsiness. I set the teapot and picked an instant coffee packet.
By the time the water boiled, she had already finished the meal. I poured the hot water into a cup. It initiated a silent sizzle and a pleasant aroma.
I got a bag of milk out of the refrigerator. I heard soft rustle and turned around, but I already knew what that was. Having put the empty, licked clean dish away, she collected her limbs together on the table, putting hands precisely in between her feet. The rustle she produced by irregularly waving the white tip of her tail.
I sighed and gave her a whole cup of milk.
"Mrawar!" She accepted it.
I poured some into my coffee and put the bag away.

Coffee was good. Simple but good. I sipped it with pleasure, waking up more and more as I believed that the coffee can keep me awake and well.
She finished her milk with a hearty sigh, murmuring "Nya".
