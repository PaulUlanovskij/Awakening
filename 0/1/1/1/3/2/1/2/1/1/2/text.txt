It is an entertaining game. 
We face the field and start. She frowns at every move, randomly sending around in time the pieces of different value. They float in space, existing and not.
I do not try to win, instead seeking the most fun moves to extend the game and watch her play. But she gets progressively less active. Eventually, she lays on the board, pushing away the figures. Having lost their precise spaces, the figures become ripped in fractal space-time paradoxes.
"Boring." That is all she states. 
I pick a rook and send it spinning inertially into infinity. "You want to rest?"
"Nah."
Then there are no more options.
