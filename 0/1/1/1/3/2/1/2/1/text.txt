I looked at her.
She was cute. A girl with cat ears, short rare whiskers and a tail. All in black color except for some locks of hair and the tip of the tail. They were white. She was wearing the long, comfortable underwear, because she did not care to wear much clothes at home. Especially at night.
She relocated herself on the sofa and sat impatiently. "Nya'm bored."
