I sketched a circle and started playing with the pencil as I considered the ideas.
Characters of the past or acquaintances did not come to mind as something to depict. Not concentrating too hard, I started collecting the most lovely features: gentle shoulders, soft face, timid smile, medium-length slightly wavy hair, round glasses. I opened a can of Dr. Pepper, put the heaphones on and allowed myself to get lost in the process. 
After a pair of hours of challenging work I finished the picture. Her lovely features charmed me for the whole time.
She was perfect. My only regret was not photographing her before I drew the glasses.
Ever since, I drew her as my most beloved character.
