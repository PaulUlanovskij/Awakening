Half-empty shelves attracted the gaze to the jar of pickles with chili.
I had a thing for pickles and I liked things with spicy tint, so I bought them a week ago. Too bad was that I do not learn on my mistakes - last time I ate chili pepper in tiniest bits. I was not enjoying it. 
But the jar was bought and there was nothing to be done.
I popped in a pickle. It was not that bad until I swallowed it. The acid pain took over my mouth. I winced and caught another pickle with my spork, then closed the jar. The more time passed since I ate the second one, the worse it got. I grabbed a piece of stale wheat bread and chewed on it. It was bad enough by itself, but after the spicy cucumbers it was a blessing. 
Stressed, I dropped on the bed, forgetting to turn off the lights in the kitchen.
