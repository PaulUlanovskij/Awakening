Having made a breakfast, I started eating clamly in the late night. As I was donem I wanted to try to sleep through what was left of the morning, but no sooner than I relaxed my body on the bed, inspiration came to me in a jolt. I took my phone and started typing in a new bit to the story.
Words did not arrange all to easily, but I managed to write several paragraphs which delivered a nice slice of past interaction between now-ex-couple.
I put the phone away. 
Instead of dreams to my mind came a harsh development to the story. Powerless in the fight against the spirit of art, I woke up completely. I sat down on the sofa and, ignoring the back pain that came from the lack of proper rest, spent the next three hours adding all details I could think of in tired excitement.
