I crunched on a tough tasteless piece of bakery and drank half of a cup of water. Money were short lately, but I could easily save some, since I was never much interested in luxurious cuisine.
I rechecked my schedule for tomorrow two more times, assured myself that the alarm was set on the time early enough and turned off all of the lights before climbing to bed to sleep through most of the following one hundred and five minutes. It is an interesting number, would you not agree? Paradoxically, it can be divided not only by five, but also by three and even seven! Also, it makes one hour and forty-five minutes. Put otherwise, seven quarters of an hour, an irregular fraction.
It would be mentally painful to wake up this soon. But I will manage.
